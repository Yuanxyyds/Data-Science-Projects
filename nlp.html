<div id="problem-description-and-motivation." class="section level2">
<h2>Problem description and motivation.</h2>
<p>The question we want to answer is “Can we use models to predict
whether a tweet about Clash Royale will either be approval, disapproval,
or neutral towards the recent game updates and balance?” Knowing how the
player base reacts to each game update is often a crucial demand for
every game developer. However, traditional methods of survey usually
take a period of time and do not provide instant feedback which are
considered more valuable often, and survey is also very much a passive
way of collecting data. Other methods like analysis of revenue gain, or
player count changes are even more on the inefficient side, and would
require a long wait period before these data can even be collected.
Thus, analysis of Twitter data would provide a quick and easy access of
the needed data that offers some insights into the immediate reaction of
the players as soon as an update is released. Furthermore, building a
machine learning model classifier could very well take into account the
fact that they’re a mixture of opinions through designing labels and
categories to represent different attitudes. Although none analysis have
been found directly related to data that of the game “Clash Royale”,
similar analysis on game reviews have appeared at least a few times over
the course of investigation, for example, “Twitter sentiment analysis of
game reviews using machine learning techniques”1 is a fairly similar one
which we will use as comparison throughout this analysis. 1 Kiran, T. D.
V. et al. “Twitter sentiment analysis of game reviews using machine
learning techniques.” (2016).</p>
</div>
<div id="describe-the-data." class="section level2">
<h2>Describe the data.</h2>
<p>Using the Python library ‘Tweepy’, we extracted 397 relevant tweets
with the search queries “<span class="citation">@ClashRoayle</span>
Update” and “<span class="citation">@ClashRoyale</span> Balance”, these
two are the main phrases that players typically include as they tweet
about the updates. We’ve restricted the search results to tweets only
for easier analysis purpose and have used the parameter “tweet_mode =
extended” to disengage the 140 characters limit of the Twitter API.
Then, we manually labeled the sentiment of the tweets as either ‘0’, for
being neutral about the update or informative matters like reporting a
bug, ‘1’ for being in favor/approval of the update, and lastly ‘2’ for
being disapproving/hating the update. Then we’ve made the tweets into a
70-30 split for a training and testing set. Some strengths about our
data are that they’re quite relevant and recent (tweets within 7 days)
to the topic; they’re all manually labeled, which allows us to use
supervised learning methods; and lastly, most tweets have “strong
opinions”, especially for the negative ones where even vulgar languages
are used, which in turns is actually advantageous for NLP. The
limitations are in a sense related to the strengths. Manual labeling are
affected by human inconsistency (which is reduced through having both
individuals labeling the data together), recent data means that the data
are collected within a short period of time which make them more prone
to being biased, lastly, since tweets contains many ambiguous wordings
involving internet slang, abbreviations, and sometime sarcasms, these
would’ve likely reduced the performance of our analysis in some degree.
In comparison, the game review analysis had 21,000 tweets as their data,
yet they still reported very similar concerns about the limitation of
their data and the difficulties with tackling these problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis." class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory data analysis.</h2>
<p>After manually labeling all the tweets, we have firstly created a bar
plot demonstrating the distribution of people’s attitude toward the game
to have a better understanding with our data. It turns out to be around
40% tweets are either irrelevant or neutral, and the ratio for both
positive tweets and negative tweets are 30%. Then, we have performed a
series of preprocessing steps to transform our data into a
computer-understandable form while extracting key information from the
raw dataset. This includes: Tokenization, which we splitted the tweets
into individual words; URL, special character and stop word removal2,
which helps us exclude unnecessary (meaningless) words that have no real
effect on the result; Lemmatization and Lowercase the words, which
convert all vocabulary to their simplest form to avoid the duplication
in meaning. Lastly, we have converted these lists of words into a word
count matrix by using Count Vectorization and a word ratio matrix by
using TF-IDF so that we have numerical representations of our tweets
that can be easily fitted into a model.</p>
</div>
<div id="machine-learning-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
<p>As a main goal for our investigation, we want to explore the best
model that can categorize the tweets most accurately. Thus, we have
constructed four different models in which we can make comparisons among
them to choose the “best”. The first two models are built based on the
Naive Bayes model. One of them is using the count vector as input and
the other one is using the TF-IDF as input. The Naive Bayes algorithm
has constructed a posterior distribution which allows us to predict the
most 2 We have removed the Top 100 English stop words by applying Python
package nltk.stopwords</p>
<p>probable class with the given dataset (count vector). As a condition,
it is a supervised model which requires the training dataset to be
labeled. Since our data is properly pre-labeled, the Naive Bayes model
is an appropriate choice for our research question. As strengths, Naive
Bayes is highly related to every word feature. However, if we have too
many unnecessary words, this can also be a weakness which decreases the
significance of key words. To solve this weakness, we have also
constructed a Classification Decision Tree with a depth of five. With a
Classification Tree, we can visualize how each class is being
categorized under some key words. By using a depth of five, it is still
related to some of the word features while not getting overfitting. As a
biggest weakness, the Classification Tree only makes predictions based
on a small part of word features. But it is still appropriate especially
for us to visualize our model and it works better when we have limited
word features. Lastly, we have fitted in a support vector machine model
in order to compare with our existing models. Similar to the Naive Bayes
algorithm, SVM also minimizes the error while splitting classes with
given input. It is another great classification model which has been
applied in many other NLP researches. For each model, we compute both
its test accuracy and train accuracy, as well as its confusion matrix to
test their overall behavior and the evidence of overfitting. In
addition, we have introduced another variable named “accuracy for class
1(positive) &amp; 2(negative)” as an indicator to models’ behavior,
which tests the probability of correctly identifying the positive and
negative tweets.</p>
</div>
<div id="results-and-conclusions." class="section level2">
<h2>Results and Conclusions.</h2>
<p>It is evident that our models were, although not in the best forms
possible, but still to some degree assisted with predicting the
corresponding attitude of a tweet about the Clash Royale update. Out of
all the methods, the Naive Bayes classifier with the countvectorizer
performed the best (Highest overall accuracy and accuracy for class 1
&amp; 2). It has a train accuracy of 92%, a test accuracy of 67% and a
test accuraacy on Class 1 &amp; 2 of 61%. Yet all models demonstrate
signs of overfitting, seen by a large difference between the train and
test accuracy. This is most likely due to the small dataset that we’ve
fed into our models and would be better addressed with more data. In
regards to the initial question, we can claim to have at least found a
more efficient way to determine the general reactions and feedback of
the players after an update of Clash Royale, where there are certainly
still rooms for improvements. Perhaps a smarter EDA process such as
removing repeated tweets and filtering spam would be a start to
improving the accuracy.</p>
