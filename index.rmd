## Introduction

Welcome! On this page, you will find an assortment of my data science projects and assignments, showcasing the cool and diverse work I have done in the field. Feel free to explore and discover the exciting data-driven insights and analyses I have developed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, include = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  category = c( "Sleep","Working", "Working..."),
  value1 = c(10, 20, 25),
  value2 = c(5, 8, 12)
)


ggplot(data, aes(category, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = value1), stat = "identity") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = value2), stat = "identity", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "About Me", y = "Scale") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
